# Assessment Project: Swarming Drones Control Center

> Partially generated with the aid of ChatGPT-4

## Objective

Students are required to develop a Swarming Drones Control Center application that simulates the coordination and control of multiple drones in a swarm for various use cases. The application will have a modern, responsive web user interface, incorporating video display, basic machine vision functions, and a scalable design that can manage swarms of varying sizes.

## Technology Stack

- Back-end: Python (FastAPI recommended)
- Front-end: JavaScript (framework of your choice) and CSS
- Third-party libraries (with appropriate licenses and attribution)

## Duration

The project should take approximately 4 weeks to complete, with students working 4 hours per week on campus and an additional 2 hours per week at home.

## Project Requirements

1. User Interface (ICTPRG535)
   a. Develop a modern, responsive web user interface that is easy to navigate and visually appealing.
   b. Provide storyboarding or wireframes for the proposed UI and UI interaction.
   c. Implement client-side validation logic.
   d. Incorporate personalization features such as a customizable dashboard or dark/light themes.

2. User Experience (ICTPRG535)
   a. Validate and improve user experience based on user feedback and testing.
   b. Implement either graphics or multimedia capabilities in the UI.

3. Application Development (ICTPRG547)
   a. Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and logging-based debugging.
   b. Seek and respond to feedback in a streamlined, responsive, and agile way.
   c. Use third-party libraries in the construction of the application, including referencing third-party documentation.

4. Drones Coordination and Control (ICTPRG547)
   a. Integrate Tello EDU drones and the official SDK into the application.
   b. Design the application to scale from 8 drones to dozens or even hundreds of drones.
   c. Display video from the drones' cameras within the UI.
   d. Implement basic machine vision functions of the lecturer's choosing for a specific use case.

4. Drones Coordination and Control (ICTPRG547)
   - Integration of Tello EDU drones and SDK
   - Scalability of the application
   - Video display within the UI
   - Basic machine vision functions for a specific use case

## Submission Requirements

1. Code Submission:
   a. Submit a compressed .zip file containing the entire project code, including the .git folder.

2. Project Write-up:
   a. Explain why you chose this particular project.
   b. Describe the primary persona the UI is targeted at.
   c. Detail the steps you took to validate the UI.

3. UI Design:
   a. Include a UI prototype and/or storyboard showcasing the design and interaction of the application.

4. Third-Party Licenses and Certificate of Originality:
   a. List all third-party code used in your project, specifying the corresponding licenses.
   b. Specify which parts of the code were created in collaboration with ChatGPT and their proportion.
   c. Include all ChatGPT transcripts related to the project development.

5. Certificate of Originality:
   a. Provide a signed statement confirming that the submitted work is your original work, except for the acknowledged third-party code and ChatGPT contributions.

Please ensure that all submission requirements are met before submitting your project for assessment. Failure to include any of the required elements may result in a Not Yet Competent (NYC) outcome.

## Outcome

Upon completion of the project, students will be assessed as either Competent (CO), meaning all required components were evidenced, or Not Yet Competent (NYC).
