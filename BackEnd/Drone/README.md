# Welcome to InterSwarmX

> The following repository contains code for workplace simulation and is not designed for commercial application

We focus on creating a coordinated control plane that allows highly sophisticated swarming behavior with commodity drones. For example, agriculture, allowing drones to perform coordinated seeding activity, find and track missing animals by not only following them but calling in reinforcements; security applications, and mining such as 3D imaging and site inspection.

## Mission

The whole is greater than the sum of the parts: we make it easy to create commercial deployments for advanced drone applications (highly coordinated, AI, and machine vision driven) using the cheapest available commodity drones.

## MVP

Create a demonstration application to showcase the capabilities of our framework.
